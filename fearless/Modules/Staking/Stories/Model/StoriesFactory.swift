This increases the security and reliability of the network and is an alternative to mining in Proof-of-Work systems (e.g. Bitcoin). Token-holders who participate in staking are compensated through block rewards and transaction fees.",

                   "The staking system pays out rewards essentially equally to all validators regardless of stake. Having more stake on a validator does not influence the amount of block rewards it receives. However, there is a probabilistic component to reward calculation (discussed below), so rewards may not be exactly equal for all validators in a given era.",

            StorySlide(description: "Nominators secure the Relay Chain by selecting good validators and staking DOT. You may have an account with DOT and want to earn fresh DOT. You could do so as validator, which requires a node running 24/7. If you do not have such node or do not want to bother, you can still earn DOT by nominating one or more validators. By doing so, you become a nominator for the validator(s) of your choice. Pick your validators carefully - if they do not behave properly, they will get slashed and you will lose DOT as well. However, if they do follow the rules of the network, then you can share in staking rewards that they generate. ",

These participants will play a crucial role in adding new blocks to the Relay Chain and, by extension, to all parachains. This allows parties to complete cross-chain transactions via the Relay Chain.",

            StorySlide(description: "Validators perform two functions. First, verifying that the information contained in an assigned set of parachain blocks is valid (such as the identities of the transacting parties and the subject matter of the contract). Their second role is to participate in the consensus mechanism to produce the Relay Chain blocks based on validity statements from other validators. Any instances of non-compliance with the consensus algorithms result in punishment by removal of some or all of the validator‚Äôs staked DOT, thereby discouraging bad actors.",
